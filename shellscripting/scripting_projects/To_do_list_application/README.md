# 1. To-Do List Application
  - Create a simple to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. This project will help you practice basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and work with user input.

## Features:

  - Add tasks to the to-do list.
  - Remove tasks from the list.
  - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
  - Display the list of tasks with their status.
  
## Example Steps:

  - Set up a basic structure for your application (e.g., using a text file, a simple database, or an in-memory list).
  - Implement functions to add, remove, and update tasks.
Create a simple user interface (CLI, GUI, or web-based).
  - Allow users to interact with the application through the interface.
  
## Skills Practiced:

  - Basic programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions).
  - Working with user input and output.
  - Basic data storage and manipulation.
  - Simple UI design.
