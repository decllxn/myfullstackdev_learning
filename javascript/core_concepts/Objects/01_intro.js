const car = {
    type:"Fiat",
    model:"500",

// Object definition
// Using an object constructor
// We use the new keyword
// Object literals are also called object initializers

const person = {
    firstname:"John",
    lastname:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyeColor:"blue"
}

// You can use the new Object(), key word to initialize an object

const house = new Object() // object created

// Properties added
house.place = "Runda";
house.bedrooms = 4;
house.floors = 3;
house.material = "wood";
